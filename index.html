  <h1>QuitLog Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>At QuitLog, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use our habit tracking and streak management app.</p>
  <p><strong>This policy is effective as of May 12, 2025.</strong></p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information through third-party services to help us improve QuitLog and provide a better experience:</p>

  <h3>1. Amplitude Analytics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g., operating system, device model)</li>
    <li>Log data (e.g., session duration, usage time)</li>
    <li>Interaction data (e.g., which features are used)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Adapty SDK</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In-app purchase history</li>
    <li>Subscription status</li>
    <li>Device identifiers, IP address, and region</li>
  </ul>

  <p>QuitLog does not collect or store user-created habits or streak logs on our servers. All tracking data stays local unless explicitly synced through third-party services (e.g., analytics).</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking</h2>
  <p>We use tracking technologies through Amplitude and Adapty to understand app usage patterns and improve your experience. You can manage tracking preferences through your device settings.</p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Payments are processed via the Apple App Store. We use Adapty SDK to manage access to premium features and analyze subscription behavior. We do not store any payment details on our servers.</p>

  <p>We may share limited data with the following partners strictly for functionality and analytics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Amplitude (usage analytics)</li>
    <li>Adapty (subscription and purchase handling)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may also disclose information when required by law (e.g., court orders or legal processes).</p>

  <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit tracking via your device privacy settings</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app to stop all data collection</li>
    <li>Use app settings (where available) to manage data usage</li>
